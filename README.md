# Merge Sort in Java

This is a basic implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in Java. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides an array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

2. Modify the main method in the MergeSort class to use your own array of numbers.

3. Run the program.
